5: Environment Boost (your type is stronger in its ideal environment)
6: Double Vision (you get to move twice but start with a -2 point disadvantage)
7: Tough Spot (your guard is more effective in a bad environment)
8: Iron Armor (you lose your normal attack but your guard is twice as effective)
9: Neutral Response (you are unaffected by the environment, no advantage or disadvantage)
