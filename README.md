OOP Animal Assignment pits 2 animals against each other in combat. You can choose each animal and customize their attribute in freeplay mode, or you can customize 1 animal in normal mode and have it face against a preset animal.

Battles will use a point system; each animal's action in battle can earn them points which can be influenced by the environment and their attributes. There are 3 rounds, and the animal with the most points wins the battle.

You can attack, guard, or use a special move specific to each animal's type (but only once per battle).
